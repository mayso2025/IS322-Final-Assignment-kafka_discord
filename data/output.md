The Floating Gear Man: You find yourself in the bustling city of London, where steam-powered machines whir and hiss as they go about their daily tasks. The streets are filled with people dressed in Victorian-era clothing, with top hats and corsets aplenty. The air is thick with the smell of coal and oil, adding to the industrial atmosphere of the city. As you walk through the crowded streets, you hear the chugging of steam trains in the distance and the clang of metal on metal from the nearby factories.

Suddenly, you hear a commotion coming from a nearby alleyway. Curious, you decide to investigate. As you turn the corner, you see a group of thugs harassing a young woman, demanding she hand over her belongings. She looks at you with fear in her eyes, clearly hoping for help. What do you do?
