The Floating Gear Man: You find yourself in the bustling city of London, where towering steampunk machines chug along the cobblestone streets. Steam billows out from pipes and gears turn relentlessly in every corner. The sky is filled with airships of all shapes and sizes, adding to the mechanical symphony of the city. 

As you walk through the crowded streets, you hear the clang of hammers on metal coming from the many workshops and forges that line the road. The smell of coal and oil fills your nostrils, mixing with the scent of freshly baked pastries from a nearby bakery. 

Suddenly, a messenger runs up to you, out of breath, and hands you a letter sealed with a wax stamp. The letter is an invitation to a grand inventor's ball being held at the prestigious Clockwork Manor. It promises a night of intrigue, innovation, and perhaps a chance to mingle with the elite inventors of the city. 

Excited by the prospect of such an event, what do you do?
