# Modified OpenAI Discord DND ChatBot + RAG 

My final project originally was supposed to be a mixture of kafka and openAI. However due to time constraints and a deadlock in trying to figure out why Kafka refused to connect to kafka:9292. I opted instead to take my original idea of a RAG powered DND program and expand upon it.This directory has the RAG tutorial code from the midterm + a edited version of the professor's kafka_discord code which only includes a discord bot powered soley by openai and no kafka integration. 

Disregrad below as these are the instructions for everything
