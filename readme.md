# Modified OpenAI Discord DND ChatBot + RAG 

My final project originally was supposed to be a mixture of kafka and openAI. However due to time constraints and a deadlock in trying to figure out why Kafka refused to connect to kafka:9292. I opted instead to take my original idea of a RAG powered DND program and expand upon it.This directory has the RAG tutorial code from the midterm + a edited version of the professor's kafka_discord code which only includes a discord bot powered soley by openai and no kafka integration. 

Plans for the summer or the future: 
Automate the outputing either the docker logs OR the discord messages (user and bot)
Use RAG to retrieve that data. use said data as respones OR new prompts. 
Repeat cycle essentially creating an endless AI generated Dungeons and Dragons campaign. 
Find ways to include more players  

Alternatively work on creating a basic discord AI chatbot that can be used as like a catered chatGPT with humor and information that a particular group enjoys such as gaming communities specifically catered towards indie games.
